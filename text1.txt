Linear regression is a statistical method used to model and analyze the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The main type of linear regression is simple linear regression, which is used when there are two variables. There are multiple types of regression, including: 1) Linear Regression 2) Multiple Regression 3) Polynomial Regression 4) Ridge Regression 5) Lasso Regression 6) Logistic Regression, among others. Logistic regression is used when the dependent variable is categorical in nature. It estimates the probability that a given instance belongs to a particular category. Statistical significance indicates whether an observed result in a study is likely to be genuine or if it could be due to random chance. Typically, a result is considered statistically significant if its p-value is below a predetermined threshold, commonly 0.05. Regression models can be evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared, and Adjusted R-squared. Evaluation metrics are a set of measures used to assess the performance of a machine learning model or algorithm. They help in understanding how well a model is performing in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, etc., relative to the problem\'s requirements. The types of evaluation metrics depend on the type of machine learning problem: For regression tasks, commonly used metrics are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. For classification tasks, commonly used metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC). Training data is used to train a machine learning model, allowing it to learn patterns or relationships within the data. Testing data, which the model hasn\'t seen during training, is used to evaluate the model\'s performance to ensure it generalizes well to new, unseen data. Cross-validation is a technique where the training dataset is split multiple times into different training and validation sets. It helps in assessing the model\'s performance more robustly, reducing the risk of overfitting, and making better use of limited data. Common methods include k-fold cross-validation. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too closely, including its noise and outliers. This results in a model that performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. Underfitting happens when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and testing datasets. Some common methods to combat overfitting include: 1) Gathering more data 2) Using regularization techniques 3) Reducing the complexity of the model 4) Using cross-validation 5) Pruning (for decision trees) 6) Early stopping (for neural networks). To address underfitting, one can: 1) Increase model complexity 2) Gather more relevant features 3) Reduce regularization 4) Modify model architecture (for neural networks). Handling imbalanced data can involve: 1) Resampling techniques (either oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class) 2) Using synthetic data generation methods like SMOTE 3) Using different evaluation metrics that are more sensitive to imbalances, such as the F1-score or AUC-ROC 4) Adjusting class weights in the algorithm. For skewed data, one can: 1) Apply log or square root transformations 2) Use non-linear algorithms that can handle skewness 3) Bin the data into different categories 4) Use algorithms robust to outliers like tree-based methods. Outliers can be identified using methods like visual inspection (e.g., scatter plots, box plots), statistical measures (e.g., z-scores, IQR). To fix outliers, one can: 1) Remove them 2) Cap them at certain threshold values 3) Use robust algorithms that are less sensitive to outliers 4) Transform the data. Interpolation involves estimating values between two known values in a dataset, while extrapolation involves predicting values outside the range of the known data points. The former is generally more reliable than the latter, which can have higher uncertainty. Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data, meaning both the input and the corresponding desired output are provided. The model learns a mapping from inputs to outputs. Common examples include classification and regression tasks. Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, aiming to find patterns or structures in the data without explicit guidance. Common methods include clustering (grouping similar data points) and dimensionality reduction. Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties and adjusts its strategy accordingly. Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, algorithms, and systems to extract insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data. It encompasses various techniques from statistics, machine learning, and big data analytics to analyze and interpret complex data. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from and make decisions based on data without being explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms that improve their performance or make accurate predictions based on past data. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. It aims to make it possible for computers to read, understand, and derive meaning from human language. Data science encompasses a broad set of tools and techniques to handle, analyze, and visualize data, including machine learning and advanced analytics. Data analytics, on the other hand, is more focused on processing and performing statistical analysis of datasets to discover insights or inform business decisions. Python is popular in data science due to its simplicity and readability, combined with a wide range of data analytics libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. Its versatility and open-source nature, along with a strong supporting community, make it an ideal choice for various data-related tasks. Logistic regression is a statistical method used for modeling the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables. It\'s commonly used for classification tasks such as spam detection or medical diagnosis. Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a metric that measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values. It is used to evaluate the performance of regression models; lower values indicate a better fit of the model to the data. Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a function iteratively. It\'s commonly used in training machine learning models. By calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model\'s parameters, the model updates its parameters in the direction that decreases the error. The process is repeated until convergence or a set number of iterations. Linear regression is used when there\'s a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. It\'s commonly applied for predicting numerical values, such as stock prices, sales forecasting, and trend analysis. Logistic regression is used for binary classification problems, where the outcome can take one of two classes. Examples include spam detection, customer churn prediction, and medical diagnosis (e.g., disease presence or absence). A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of classification models by comparing the actual vs. predicted classifications. It contains values like True Positives, False Positives, True Negatives, and False Negatives. The True Positive Rate (TPR), also known as sensitivity or recall, measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified. The False Positive Rate (FPR) measures the proportion of actual negatives that are incorrectly identified as positive. Data science focuses on analyzing and interpreting complex data to derive insights and build predictive models, using statistical, mathematical, and computational methods. Software engineering, on the other hand, is about designing, developing, and maintaining software applications, ensuring they run efficiently and meet user requirements. In supervised learning, models are trained on labeled data, meaning both inputs and desired outputs are provided. It\'s used for tasks like classification and regression. Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data and aims to find patterns or structures, with methods like clustering or dimensionality reduction. Long format data (or tidy format) has one row for each observation and one column for each variable, making it long and narrow. Wide format data has one row per subject and variables in both rows and columns, making it wide. For instance, a dataset with daily temperature readings would have a single column for temperature in long format and separate columns for each day in wide format. Structured data is organized in a predefined manner, often in tables with rows and columns, like databases or Excel spreadsheets. Unstructured data doesn\'t have a specific form or structure, including texts, images, videos, and more. Sampling involves selecting a subset of individuals from a larger population to estimate characteristics of the whole population. It\'s used when analyzing the entire dataset is impractical or time-consuming. Methods include random sampling, stratified sampling, and cluster sampling. Common sampling techniques include: 1) Simple Random Sampling 2) Stratified Sampling 3) Cluster Sampling 4) Systematic Sampling 5) Convenience Sampling. Sampling bias occurs when some members of the intended population are more or less likely to be included in the sample than others, leading to a non-representative sample. This can skew results and reduce the generalizability of the findings. Dimensionality reduction refers to techniques used to reduce the number of input variables in a dataset. It can help in visualization, improving model performance, and reducing computational costs. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-SNE are common methods. Classification is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict the categorical class labels of new instances, based on past observations. Examples include email spam detection and image categorization. Decision trees are a type of machine learning model that make decisions based on posing a series of questions to the data, each question narrowing the possible values, much like the game "20 Questions." They are intuitive and can be visualized graphically. Data cleaning involves identifying and correcting errors and inconsistencies in data to enhance its quality. With Python, libraries like Pandas can be used for tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types. Data wrangling, often termed as data munging, is the process of transforming and mapping data from its raw form into another format for better understanding and use in further analysis. Data munging is synonymous with data wrangling. It involves cleaning, structuring and enriching raw data into a desired format for better decision-making in less time. Data analytics involves examining raw data to draw conclusions and extract insights. It encompasses a variety of quantitative and qualitative techniques, from basic statistics to complex machine learning models, to understand and derive insights from data. Data mining is the process of discovering patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data. The sources can include databases, data warehouses, and more. It involves methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems. A data warehouse is a large, centralized repository of data that combines data from various sources to support business intelligence activities, including data analytics and reporting. It separates analytical processing from transactional databases to ensure data consistency and performance. Some popular Python data science libraries include: 1) Pandas: data manipulation and analysis 2) NumPy: numerical operations and matrix computation 3) Scikit-learn: machine learning algorithms 4) Matplotlib and Seaborn: data visualization 5) TensorFlow and PyTorch: deep learning. A loss function, in machine learning, measures how well a prediction model does in terms of being able to predict the expected outcome. It quantifies the difference between the predicted and actual values. The sigmoid function is an S-shaped curve that can take any real-valued number and map it between 0 and 1. It\'s often used in logistic regression to represent probabilities. The loss function computes the error for a single training example, while the cost function is the average of the loss functions for all the training examples. In simpler terms, loss function is applied to individual data points, and the cost function is the overall performance metric of the model on the entire dataset. K-fold cross validation is a technique where the training dataset is split into \'k\' equal-sized subsets. The model is trained on k-1 of these folds and tested on the remaining fold. This process is repeated k times, each time with a different test fold. It helps in assessing the model\'s generalization capability. Recommender systems suggest items to users based on learned patterns from past user interactions. Techniques include collaborative filtering (based on users\' past behavior) and content-based filtering (based on item attributes). Hybrid methods combine both approaches. The Poisson distribution represents the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. It\'s characterized by the average rate (lambda) of the events. It\'s often used in scenarios like counting the number of emails arriving in an hour or the number of phone calls at a call center. Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes\' theorem, with the "naive" assumption of independence between every pair of features. It\'s often used for text classification tasks, like spam detection and sentiment analysis. The Gaussian distribution, also known as the normal distribution, is a bell-shaped curve characterized by a mean (mu) and standard deviation (sigma). Data values in a Gaussian distribution are symmetrically distributed around the mean. In a uniform distribution, all values have the same frequency/probability. For a continuous uniform distribution, any value within a range has an equal likelihood of occurring. The normal distribution is another term for the Gaussian distribution. It describes a continuous variable whose probabilities are symmetrically distributed around the mean, forming a bell-shaped curve. Standard deviation measures the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values from the mean. A low standard deviation indicates values are close to the mean, while a high one suggests a wider spread. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that utilizes neural networks with many layers (hence "deep"). It\'s particularly effective for large and complex datasets, such as images and natural language processing tasks. Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain\'s network of neurons. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes or "neurons" that process information and can adapt to perform specific tasks by adjusting their weights based on input data. Deep learning has various applications, including image and speech recognition, language translation, playing games, medical diagnosis, and financial forecasting, among others. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning model primarily used for image processing and computer vision tasks. They use convolutional layers to scan for local features in an image. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are designed for sequential data and tasks where past information is crucial for future predictions, like time series forecasting or natural language processing. They have connections that loop back on themselves, allowing them to retain past information. Selection bias occurs when the sample obtained is not representative of the population intended to be analyzed. This can result in incorrect conclusions as certain segments might be overrepresented or underrepresented. To become a data scientist, one typically needs skills in programming (e.g., Python, R), statistical analysis, machine learning, data wrangling, domain-specific knowledge, communication, and visualization tools, among others. Dropout is a regularization technique used in neural networks where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, preventing co-adaptation of neurons and helping the model generalize better to unseen data. Some popular deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Caffe, and Theano. These frameworks provide tools to design, train, and validate deep neural networks. The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier as its discrimination threshold varies. It plots the True Positive Rate against the False Positive Rate. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) measures the classifier\'s performance. A random forest is an ensemble machine learning model that consists of multiple decision trees. It aggregates the outputs of individual trees to produce a final result, typically aiming to reduce overfitting and improve generalization. Data modeling refers to defining the structure, relationships, and constraints of data you are working with, often visualized as an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram). Database design, on the other hand, involves the physical implementation of the data model into a database system, considering aspects like performance, scalability, and resilience. Accuracy is a metric that measures the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total number of instances. It\'s given by (True Positives + True Negatives) / Total Instances. Precision measures the ratio of correctly predicted positive instances to the total predicted positives. It\'s given by True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives). Recall (or Sensitivity) measures the ratio of correctly predicted positive instances to all actual positives. It\'s given by True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives). The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, offering a balance between the two. It\'s given by 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall). A p-value is a measure used in hypothesis testing to determine the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis. A small p-value (typically ≤ 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, suggesting it can be rejected. A t-test is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. It\'s commonly used when the data sets are approximately normally distributed and have similar variances. A z-score indicates how many standard deviations an element is from the mean of a dataset. It\'s used for standardizing scores, identifying outliers, and determining the relative standing of a value within a distribution. An error is the difference between the observed value and the true value. A residual, on the other hand, is the difference between the observed value and the predicted value provided by a model. The terms are often used interchangeably, but they have different meanings in a modeling context. Machine learning is a subset of data science focused on the development of algorithms that can learn patterns from data. Data science is a broader field that encompasses various aspects of data processing, analysis, visualization, and prediction, using various tools and techniques, including but not limited to machine learning. Univariate analysis examines one variable at a time. Its purpose is to describe the data and find patterns within it, often visualized using histograms, box plots, or probability distributions. Bivariate analysis examines the relationship between two variables to determine if there is an association between them. Techniques include scatter plots, correlation coefficients, and cross-tabulations. Multivariate analysis deals with the examination of multiple variables simultaneously. It aims to understand the relationships between them and the effects they have on each other. Common techniques include multiple regression, factor analysis, and multivariate ANOVA. In Python, libraries like Pandas offer methods to handle missing data, including dropping rows or columns (dropna()) or filling in missing values with mean, median, mode, or a specific value (fillna()). The bias-variance tradeoff refers to the balance between the error due to bias (underfitting) and the error due to variance (overfitting). Ideally, a model should have low bias and low variance, but improving one often comes at the expense of the other. A prediction model is an algorithm or statistical model used to determine future outcomes based on input data. It\'s trained on historical data and then used to predict future events or classify new data points. RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) is a metric that measures the differences between predicted and observed values. It gives an idea of the magnitude of error and is particularly useful when larger errors are more significant. SVM (Support Vector Machine) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification or regression. It aims to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates data classes. A kernel function is used in SVM to transform non-linearly separable data into a higher dimension where it becomes linearly separable. Common kernels include linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid. Selecting the appropriate k in k-means can be done using methods like the "elbow method," where the variance explained as a function of the number of clusters is plotted, and the "elbow" point (where the rate of decrease sharply changes) is a good candidate for k. Ensemble learning involves combining multiple machine learning models to achieve better predictive performance than any of the individual models alone. Techniques include bagging, boosting, and stacking. A/B testing, also known as split testing, is an experimental method to compare two versions (A and B) of a webpage, app, or other product against each other to determine which one performs better in terms of a specific metric, such as conversion rate. Bagging, or Bootstrap Aggregating, is an ensemble method that involves creating multiple subsets of the original dataset (with replacement), training a model on each, and then averaging the results (for regression) or voting (for classification) to produce a final prediction. Boosting is an ensemble method where models are trained sequentially, with each new model attempting to correct the errors of the previous ones. This results in a combined model with improved performance. Stacking involves using predictions from multiple models as input for a final "meta-model" that makes the final prediction. It leverages the strengths of various models to improve overall accuracy. Machine learning is a broader field encompassing algorithms that can learn from data. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning focused on algorithms inspired by the structure of the human brain, called artificial neural networks, and particularly on networks with many layers (deep neural networks). In Naive Bayes, "Naive" refers to the assumption that all features are independent of each other given the class label, which is a simplification and often not strictly true in real-world data. Batch normalization is a technique used in deep learning to normalize the activations of a layer so that they have a mean close to 0 and a standard deviation close to 1. It can help improve the speed, performance, and stability of neural networks. Batch gradient descent computes the gradient using the entire dataset and updates weights once per epoch. Stochastic gradient descent updates weights after each training example. Mini batch gradient descent is a compromise between the two, updating weights after a subset (mini-batch) of the training data. An activation function is a function used in neural networks that introduces non-linearity into the model. Common examples include ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh. A random forest model is built by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes for classification or mean prediction of the individual trees for regression. It leverages bagging and feature randomness to ensure diversity among the trees. Overfitting can be avoided through techniques like cross-validation, regularization, pruning (for decision trees), increasing training data, using simpler models, and using ensemble methods. Variance measures the dispersion or spread of a set of data points. It calculates the average of the squared differences from the mean. High variance indicates that the data points are spread out from the mean and from each other. Pruning involves removing parts of a decision tree that do not provide power to classify instances. It helps reduce the complexity of the final classifier, making it simpler and less prone to overfitting. Entropy is a measure of the randomness or unpredictability in a data set. In decision trees, it\'s used to measure the impurity or disorder of a set of instances. The goal in building a decision tree is to have leaves with entropy of 0, indicating pure nodes. Time series data is a sequence of data points, typically consisting of successive measurements made over a time interval. Examples include stock prices over time or daily temperature readings. Time series forecasting involves using past data to predict future data points in the series. Common methods include ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and LSTM networks. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus). It considers both the frequency of a word in a document and its inverse frequency in the corpus. Dealing with unbalanced classification can involve resampling techniques (oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class), using different evaluation metrics (like F1-score or AUC-ROC), or using algorithms that allow for class weight adjustments. For time series data, "Time Series Split" or "Rolling Forecast Origin" cross-validation is appropriate. It involves training on a continuously expanding window of the data and testing on a fixed-size subsequent window, ensuring data in the past is used to predict data in the future. A point estimate provides a single value as an estimate of a parameter (e.g., sample mean). A confidence interval, on the other hand, provides a range of values that likely contains the population parameter with a specified level of confidence. KPI stands for Key Performance Indicator. It\'s a measurable value that demonstrates how effectively an organization is achieving its key business objectives. KPIs can be used at various levels to evaluate success in reaching targets. Model fitting refers to the process of training a model on data, adjusting its parameters to minimize the difference between the predicted values and the observed values. A well-fitted model will capture the underlying patterns in the data without overfitting or underfitting. Robustness refers to a model\'s ability to perform well not only on the training data but also on new, unseen data, especially when the data contains noise, outliers, or other unexpected elements. A robust model is resistant to perturbations in the input data. DOE stands for Design of Experiments. It\'s a systematic method to determine the relationship between factors affecting a process and the output of that process. It\'s used to both optimize and validate manufacturing processes and designs. Large language models (LLMs) are machine learning models, usually based on transformer architectures, trained on vast amounts of text data. They are designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the patterns they\'ve learned from the training data. A transformer is a deep learning model introduced in the "Attention is All You Need" paper. It uses self-attention mechanisms to weigh input data differently and can process input elements in parallel (as opposed to sequences), making it highly effective for tasks like machine translation and text generation. Data is the foundation of data science. It provides the raw information that algorithms analyze and learn from. Without data, there would be no insights to draw, no patterns to recognize, and no predictions to make. The quality and quantity of data directly affect the outcomes and reliability of data science projects. R^2, or the coefficient of determination, measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables in a regression model. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect predictability. While R^2 is useful, it may not be suitable for all situations. Other metrics, like Adjusted R^2 (which accounts for the number of predictors), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), or MAE (Mean Absolute Error) might be more informative in specific contexts or for certain types of models. The curse of dimensionality refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces that do not occur in low-dimensional settings. It can lead to overfitting and makes clustering, visualization, and optimization challenging. Not necessarily. While having more data can help improve model performance, it\'s essential that the data is relevant, clean, and of high quality. Sometimes, more data can introduce noise or redundancy, or increase computational costs without significant benefits. Missing predictors can be handled by various methods such as imputation (filling in missing values using methods like mean, median, or mode), using algorithms robust to missing data, or using techniques like model-based imputation or multiple imputation. GPS data can be analyzed to derive metrics like speed, acceleration, braking patterns, route efficiency, and adherence to traffic rules. By analyzing these patterns, one can determine driving behaviors like aggressive driving, frequent hard braking, or speeding, which can be used to assess the quality of a driver. Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, thereby constraining the magnitude of model coefficients. Common methods include L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization. Regularization is important because it helps prevent overfitting, ensuring the model generalizes well to new, unseen data. By adding a penalty, it discourages overly complex models which can fit the noise in the training data. Classification algorithms predict discrete output labels or categories (e.g., spam or not spam). Regression algorithms predict continuous numeric values (e.g., house prices or stock values). The vanishing gradient problem occurs when gradients of the loss function become too small for earlier layers in a deep network, leading to negligible weight updates and prolonged, ineffective training. It\'s often observed in networks using activation functions like the sigmoid or tanh. Transfer learning is a technique where a pre-trained model on a large dataset is fine-tuned for a different, often smaller, related dataset. It leverages knowledge gained from the initial training task to boost performance on a new task. Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller pieces, typically words or subwords, called tokens. It\'s a crucial preprocessing step in many NLP tasks. Stemming reduces words to their base or root form (e.g., "running" to "run"), often using heuristic methods. Lemmatization returns the base or dictionary form of a word, considering its morphological analysis (e.g., "went" to "go"). The bag-of-words model represents text as an unordered set of its words, disregarding grammar and word order but maintaining multiplicity. It\'s a way to convert text into numerical vectors for analysis. Sentiment analysis involves determining the emotional tone or attitude expressed in a piece of text. It typically classifies text as positive, negative, or neutral using machine learning models trained on labeled sentiment data. Advanced versions may identify specific emotions or intensities. Image segmentation is the process of dividing an image into multiple segments or "regions," where each segment corresponds to different objects or parts of objects. It aims to simplify or change the representation of an image to make it more meaningful or easier to analyze. Convolution is a mathematical operation that involves taking a small, trainable filter (or kernel) and sliding it over the input data (like an image) to produce a feature map. In CNNs, this helps in capturing local features in the input, allowing the network to learn spatial hierarchies. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the process of converting images of handwritten, typed, or printed text into machine-encoded text. It\'s used for digitizing printed documents, recognizing text from images, automating data entry, and more. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of study in computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. The subfields of AI include machine learning, robotics, natural language processing, computer vision, speech processing, expert systems, and more. The Turing Test, proposed by Alan Turing, is a measure of a machine\'s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from a human\'s. If a machine passes this test, it\'s considered to have achieved a form of human-like intelligence. It\'s important as a foundational concept in the philosophy of AI. Type I error (false positive) is rejecting a true null hypothesis. Type II error (false negative) is failing to reject a false null hypothesis. Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences or decisions about population parameters based on sample data. It involves testing an assumption (null hypothesis) to determine its validity. Bootstrapping is a resampling technique used to estimate statistics on a population by sampling a dataset with replacement. It can be used to assess the robustness of statistical estimates or to derive confidence intervals. Correlation indicates a relationship between two variables, where changes in one might be associated with changes in another. Causation indicates that a change in one variable directly causes a change in another. Correlation does not imply causation. Bayes\' theorem describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge. It relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events and provides a way to update probabilities with new data. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning models where two networks, a generator and a discriminator, are trained together. The generator tries to produce fake data while the discriminator tries to distinguish it from real data. The process refines both networks. Transfer learning is a technique where a model trained on one task is repurposed and fine-tuned for a different but related task. It leverages the knowledge gained during the initial training to improve performance on the new task, especially when data for the new task is limited. An autoencoder is a type of neural network used to encode data into a lower-dimensional form and then decode it back. It\'s used for dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, and feature learning in unsupervised settings. Both Word2Vec and GloVe are methods to create word embeddings. Word2Vec captures semantic meaning based on the local context of words in texts. GloVe captures meaning based on statistical information, specifically on word co-occurrence statistics across a corpus. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the process of identifying and classifying named entities (such as persons, organizations, dates, and locations) in text into predefined categories. BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) metric evaluates the quality of translated text by comparing it to reference translations. It measures how many n-grams in the machine-generated translations match those in the reference text, providing a score between 0 and 1 (higher is better). The attention mechanism allows models to focus on specific parts of the input when producing an output. In NLP, it\'s used in sequence-to-sequence models, especially in tasks like machine translation, to weigh the importance of different input words for each output word. Word embeddings are dense vector representations of words that capture their semantic meaning. They are important because they allow models to understand word similarities and relationships, and they reduce dimensionality compared to one-hot encoded representations. L1 regularization (Lasso) adds a penalty equivalent to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients. L2 regularization (Ridge) adds a penalty equivalent to the square of the magnitude of coefficients. Lasso can induce sparsity (make coefficients zero), while Ridge tends to shrink coefficients. Ensemble learning combines predictions from multiple models to produce a final output. By leveraging the strengths of each individual model and averaging out their errors, ensemble methods often achieve higher accuracy and robustness than individual models. NER identifies and categorizes named entities in text. POS tagging identifies the grammatical parts of speech (like nouns, verbs, adjectives) for each word in a sentence. Both are regularization techniques. Lasso uses L1 regularization which can induce sparsity (make some coefficients zero). Ridge uses L2 regularization which tends to shrink coefficients but doesn\'t usually set them to zero. Cross entropy is a loss function used in classification tasks. It measures the dissimilarity between the true data distribution and the predicted distribution, penalizing incorrect probability assignments. Precision is the fraction of true positive predictions among all positive predictions. Recall (or Sensitivity) is the fraction of true positive predictions among all actual positives. AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. It evaluates a model\'s ability to differentiate between the positive and negative class. Bias-variance trade-off refers to the balance between the error due to bias (underfitting) and the error due to variance (overfitting). Ideally, a model should have low bias and low variance, but increasing one can decrease the other. Both correlation and covariance measure the relationship between two variables. While covariance only indicates the direction of the relationship (positive or negative), correlation additionally provides the degree of the relationship, normalized between -1 and 1. Common activation functions include Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), Leaky ReLU, and Softmax, each with its own properties and use-cases. Classification models can be evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, AUC, confusion matrix, among others. Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups similar data points together based on certain features, without having prior labels. Common types include K-means, Hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Agglomerative clustering. Yes, methods like the Elbow method, Silhouette analysis, and the Gap statistic can help determine the optimal number of clusters (k) in k-means. Seasonality can be treated using methods like decomposition (which breaks down time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components), seasonal differencing, and using models like SARIMA which account for seasonality. Non-stationary time series data can be transformed to be stationary using differencing, taking the logarithm, or using transformations like the Box-Cox transformation. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models time series data without considering seasonality. SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) extends ARIMA to account for seasonality by adding seasonal differencing and seasonal auto-regressive and moving average terms. Autocorrelation measures the correlation of a time series with its own past and future values. It helps in identifying repeating patterns or seasonality in time series data. Yes, deep learning can be used for time series forecasting. Models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) are popular as they can capture long-term dependencies. They work by utilizing a chain of repeating modules of neural networks to process sequential data. The null hypothesis is a statement in statistics that there is no effect or no difference, and it serves as the default or status quo to be tested against. Common types include Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation), and FastText. These methods convert words into numerical vectors capturing semantic meaning. N-grams are continuous sequences of \'n\' items (words, characters, etc.) from a text or speech. For instance, in the sentence "I love dogs", the 2-grams (or bigrams) are: "I love" and "love dogs". Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a classification task. It categorizes words or phrases in text into predefined entity classes (e.g., person, organization, location). For large datasets in NER: 1) Use distributed computing (e.g., using frameworks like Spark), 2) Train models using mini-batch gradient descent, 3) Use cloud-based platforms that can handle large-scale data, 4) Consider pruning the dataset if feasible, focusing on the most informative samples. The transformer architecture is a deep learning model introduced in the "Attention is All You Need" paper. It uses self-attention mechanisms to weigh input data differently and can process data in parallel, making it efficient and effective for tasks like language translation. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a transformer-based model trained on large amounts of text using a masked language model task. It captures context from both directions (left-to-right and right-to-left) and can be fine-tuned for specific NLP tasks. Attention mechanisms in NLP allow models to focus on specific parts of the input when producing an output. It\'s important as it enables the model to weigh the relevance of different parts of input data, enhancing the capture of contextual information. Creating a model like BERT manually involves: 1) Defining a transformer architecture with self-attention mechanisms, 2) Pre-training it on a large corpus using a masked language model task, 3) Fine-tuning the pre-trained model on specific downstream tasks. Proper dataset and computational resources are crucial. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 or BERT are designed using deep neural architectures, often transformer-based. They are trained on vast amounts of text data, enabling them to generate human-like text and understand context. LLMs can be: 1) Computationally expensive to train and deploy, 2) Biased based on the data they were trained on, 3) Prone to generating incorrect or nonsensical outputs, 4) Hard to interpret and debug due to their size and complexity. LLMs: 1) Can generate coherent, diverse, and contextually relevant text, 2) Can be fine-tuned for various NLP tasks with fewer data, 3) Have state-of-the-art performance in many tasks, 4) Offer the ability to generalize across a wide range of tasks without task-specific training data. ChatGPT doesn\'t have long-term memory of past interactions due to privacy concerns. However, during a session, it can consider immediate context provided in the input, allowing for context-aware responses within that session. Use open-source models when you need customization, transparency in the model, specific training on niche data, avoiding usage costs associated with proprietary models, or when abiding by certain licensing requirements. LLMs, like ChatGPT, utilize deep neural network architectures (often transformer-based). They are pretrained on vast amounts of text and use patterns learned to generate or classify text based on the input they receive. Fine-tuning involves training the pre-trained LLM on a specific, smaller dataset related to a particular task, allowing the model to adapt to specific nuances and requirements of that task. ChatGPT uses its learned patterns from training data to predict the next word in a sequence, generating text word by word until it forms a coherent response or reaches a specified length. Designing conversations involves understanding user intents, defining possible user inputs, crafting appropriate bot responses, handling fallbacks for unrecognized inputs, and maintaining context for coherent multi-turn conversations. Dialogflow and Rasa use intent recognition and entity extraction to understand user input. Based on the recognized intent and entities, they generate or fetch appropriate responses. Both platforms allow developers to define conversation flows and handle various user intents. Evaluation can be based on accuracy of intent recognition, quality of responses, user satisfaction surveys, the chatbot\'s ability to handle unexpected inputs, and efficiency in task completion. Common metrics include: Response time, user retention rate, session length, user satisfaction scores, fallback rate (unrecognized inputs), and task success rate. Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning method used to identify topics in a set of documents. Algorithms like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) are commonly used for this. XGBoost is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible, and portable. It boosts tree-based models\' performance and accuracy through regularization and handling of missing data. Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) is a gradient descent-based optimization algorithm that computes adaptive learning rates for each parameter. It combines the benefits of two other extensions of gradient descent: AdaGrad and RMSProp. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional form, capturing the most variance in the data using fewer components. Back propagation is an optimization algorithm used for minimizing the error in neural networks. It calculates the gradient of the error function concerning each weight by applying the chain rule, then updates the weights to minimize the error. Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. It\'s represented as P(A The exponential distribution describes the time intervals in a Poisson point process or the time between consecutive events in a continuous-time process with a constant event rate. The binomial distribution describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, with the same probability of success on each trial. The Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution for a random variable which can take only two outcomes, typically labeled 0 and 1 (e.g., success/failure). The chi-squared test assesses whether observed frequencies are different from expected frequencies in categorical variables. It\'s used for independence testing between categorical variables. The gamma distribution is a two-parameter family of continuous probability distributions, which is widely used in statistics to model continuous variables that are always positive and have skewed distributions. The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of the sum (or average) of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables approaches a Gaussian (normal) distribution, regardless of the original distribution of the variables. Marginal probability is the probability of an event occurring without reference to any other events; it\'s derived by summing joint probabilities over all values of the other variables. Collinearity refers to a condition where two or more predictor variables in a regression are highly correlated, meaning one can be linearly predicted from the others, which can distort the coefficient estimates and reduce the model\'s interpretability. Classification metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, and more, which evaluate the performance of classification algorithms. In statistics, a coefficient typically refers to the numerical or constant quantity placed before and multiplying a particular variable in an equation (e.g., the slope in a linear regression equation). It indicates the degree or magnitude of a certain relationship or effect. Mean is the average of all values in a dataset. Median is the middle value in a sorted dataset. Mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. Descriptive statistics summarizes and describes the main features of a dataset through measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc., providing a simple overview of the sample and measures of the data\'s main characteristics. Inferential statistics uses a random sample of data from a population to describe and make inferences about the population. It often involves hypothesis testing and the estimation of population parameters. Predictive analytics forecasts future trends using historical data while prescriptive analytics suggests actions to take based on predictions, aiming at achieving specific outcomes or solving particular problems. A learning curve plots the performance of a model (like accuracy or error) against the experience or training time of the model. It helps in understanding if a model benefits from more data or if it\'s overfitting/underfitting. Contour visualization represents a 3-dimensional surface on a 2-dimensional plane using contour lines, which are lines of constant value. It\'s commonly used to visualize the relationship between three continuous variables. Some optimization algorithms include Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Newton\'s Method, Genetic Algorithms, and Simulated Annealing. A decision boundary is a surface or line that separates data points belonging to different classes in a classification problem. It represents the threshold where the probability of belonging to one class vs. another is equal. The kernel trick involves using a kernel function to transform data into a higher-dimensional space, making it possible to perform linear separation in that space for problems that aren\'t linearly separable in the original space. Use techniques like cross-validation to evaluate model performance on unseen data, regularization to penalize complex models, pruning in decision trees, and gathering more data if possible. Data can be split randomly, but often it\'s divided such that around 70-80% is used for training and 20-30% is used for testing to validate the model\'s performance. Tools like train_test_split in scikit-learn can help. TPE (Tree-structured Parzen Estimator) is a Bayesian optimization method. It builds a probabilistic model of the objective function and selects new inputs to evaluate the function by applying a criterion to the model. The memory cell in an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network is its core component, regulating the flow of information through controlling gates. It can remember or forget specific information over long time intervals, making LSTMs effective for sequence prediction tasks. A loss function computes the error for a single training example. Cost function is the average loss over the entire dataset. Objective function is a more general term that may include the cost function and regularization terms. A low p-value (< 0.05) suggests that the observed effect is statistically significant and not due to random chance. A high p-value suggests the opposite. They are often used interchangeably in many contexts. The expected value is the long-run average value of a random variable, whereas the mean is the average value of a dataset. Confounding variables are external factors in an experiment or study that affect both the independent and dependent variables, potentially leading to incorrect conclusions. KNN is a non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm where the output of a new instance is predicted based on the k closest training examples in the feature space. True positives (TP) are correctly predicted positives. False positives (FP) are incorrectly predicted positives. True negatives (TN) are correctly predicted negatives. False negatives (FN) are incorrectly predicted negatives. Multicollinearity occurs when independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated, which can destabilize the model and make it hard to identify the effect of individual variables. Random forests are preferred for large datasets and when interpretability and feature importance are crucial. SVMs are powerful for higher-dimensional data and when maximum margin separation is desired. It depends. 50 small trees, like in a random forest, can capture complex patterns and reduce overfitting. A large tree might fit the training data very well but overfit and perform poorly on unseen data. AdaBoost adjusts the weights of misclassified instances at each iteration, whereas Gradient Boosting adjusts based on the negative gradient (or residuals) of the loss function. XGBoost uses gradient boosting algorithm with regularization terms, which controls the complexity of trees, helping in managing the bias-variance tradeoff. Online learning updates the model incrementally with each new data point, whereas batch learning uses the entire dataset to train the model at once. While it\'s a simple method, mean imputation doesn\'t account for inherent variability in data and can reduce the variance. It\'s generally better to use more sophisticated methods or understand the nature of missingness first. An inlier is a data point that falls within the expected range and is not considered an outlier or anomaly. Both are recommendation system techniques. Collaborative filtering recommends items based on user behavior, while content-based filtering recommends items similar to what a user likes. The similarity is in their goal: to provide personalized recommendations. Steps include handling missing values, removing duplicates, transforming variables, dealing with outliers, encoding categorical variables, and normalization or scaling. Precision is the fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances, while recall (sensitivity) is the fraction of relevant instances that have been retrieved over the total amount of relevant instances. MSE is sensitive to outliers, so it might give an overly pessimistic measure if there are large errors. It also lacks interpretability in some contexts since it doesn\'t have the same unit as the original data. Feature engineering is the process of creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve the performance of machine learning models. Methods include filter methods (e.g., correlation coefficients), wrapper methods (e.g., forward selection, backward elimination), and embedded methods (e.g., LASSO, decision trees). A neural network processes input data through layers of interconnected nodes (neurons). Each connection has a weight, and nodes apply an activation function to the incoming data. The network learns by adjusting weights based on the error in predictions. ReLU is computationally efficient, helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, and often leads to faster convergence in practice. Too high: the model might overshoot the optimal point, leading to divergence. Too low: the model converges slowly or gets stuck in local minima. It states that as the size of a sample increases, the sample mean will get closer to the population mean. It states that, given certain conditions, the mean of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables tends toward a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution. It underpins many statistical methods and tests. It states that the future state of a process is only dependent on the current state, not on the sequence of states that preceded it. The probability that a test correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. Experimental data is collected from experiments where researchers control one or more variables. Observational data is collected without any intervention from the researcher, observing natural occurrences. Incomes in a city where a few billionaires skew the mean upwards, making the median a better representation of a typical resident\'s income. It\'s the error of focusing on the subjects that "survived" some process and overlooking those that didn\'t, leading to false conclusions. Root cause analysis is a method of problem-solving aimed at identifying the root causes of problems or events. Identifying cause vs. correlation involves controlled experiments, understanding the underlying mechanisms, and using statistical methods to rule out spurious relations. A distribution with a large number of occurrences far from the mode, and few near it. It indicates a high degree of variance or outliers. It\'s used to compare two versions (A and B) of a webpage, app, or other product to determine which performs better in terms of a specific metric. By conducting hypothesis tests and calculating p-values. If the p-value is below a predetermined threshold (e.g., 0.05), the result is deemed statistically significant. A boxplot provides a summary of a data set\'s central tendency, variability, and skewness using quartiles, medians, and possible outliers. A histogram shows the frequency distribution of a data set. ACF (Auto-Correlation Function) measures the correlation between a series and its lagged values. PACF (Partial Auto-Correlation Function) measures the correlation between a series and its lagged values while controlling for the values at all shorter lags. Reduces computational costs, removes multicollinearity, helps in visualizing data, and may improve model performance by removing noise. Yes, it can speed up training, particularly in cases where there\'s a lot of redundant or irrelevant features. However, it may lose some information, so it\'s a trade-off. A convex function has a single global minimum, and any local minimum is also a global minimum. Non-convex functions have multiple local minima, making optimization more challenging. Sample size calculation depends on desired confidence level, margin of error, population variance, and effect size. Common methods include Cochran\'s formula for simple random samples. Rotation in PCA (like Varimax) can help in making the loadings of components more interpretable. It maximizes high loadings and minimizes low loadings, making it clearer which variables drive each principal component. Prior Probability: Initial belief about the probability of an outcome. Likelihood: Probability of observing the data given a particular outcome. Marginal Likelihood: Total probability of observing the data across all possible outcomes. kNN is a supervised classification algorithm that assigns a new data point to the majority class of its \'k\' nearest neighbors. kmeans is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that partitions data into \'k\' clusters based on feature similarity. They are the same. Both measure the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified. Ridge is preferable when there are many large parameters of about the same value (i.e., when most predictors are important). Lasso, due to its ability to reduce some coefficients to zero, is preferable when we believe many features are irrelevant or redundant. The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex shape that contains all the points. Euclidean Distance: Straight line distance between two points in a space. Manhattan Distance: Sum of absolute differences in their coordinates (like moving only on gridlines of a grid). Both are used in various algorithms to measure the distance/similarity between data points. A method to estimate the parameters in a linear regression model by minimizing the sum of squared differences between observed and predicted values. A method used to estimate the parameters of a statistical model by maximizing the likelihood function, which measures how well the model explains the observed data. 1. Choose an attribute to split on. 2. Calculate the best split point (using metrics like Gini impurity or entropy). 3. Create a node based on that attribute. 4. Repeat the process for the sub-nodes using the subsets of data. 5. Stop when a termination condition is met (e.g., max depth reached, minimum samples per leaf, or purity achieved). Continuously monitor its performance, periodically retrain with new data, adjust for concept drift, ensure infrastructure support, and seek user feedback. A time series is stationary if its statistical properties (mean, variance, autocorrelation) don\'t change over time. Tests like the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test can be used to check for stationarity. A feature vector is an n-dimensional vector of numerical features that represent an object in machine learning. Dependency parsing identifies grammatical relationships between words in a sentence, linking words based on their dependencies. E.g., in "She read the book", "read" is linked to "She" (subject) and "book" (object). The process of shortening a text document, retaining its most important information, to produce a concise summary. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a Python library for NLP offering a wide range of tools and English grammars. SpaCy is another Python NLP library, designed to be fast and production-ready. While NLTK is broad, SpaCy is optimized for performance and industrial use. SpaCy is a high-performance, industrial-strength NLP library in Python designed for production use. It offers pre-trained models and supports various NLP tasks. The process of automatically extracting structured information like entities, relationships, and events from unstructured text. Ambiguity arising from context or the way something is said rather than language structure or word meanings. It\'s about interpreting the speaker\'s intended meaning. A measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors, often used to measure similarity between text documents represented as vectors (e.g., TF-IDF vectors). A type of language model where some words in the input are masked (hidden), and the model is trained to predict those masked words from their context. BERT is an example. NLP deals with the processing and understanding of human language. CI (or chatbot) uses NLP techniques to facilitate human-computer interaction in a conversational manner. (Repeated question; see above) Dependency parsing identifies grammatical relationships between words in a sentence, based on their dependencies. Problem definition, data collection, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring. Parameters not learned from the training data, set before training starts. Examples: learning rate, number of hidden layers in a neural network. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network that can learn and remember over long sequences and is less susceptible to the vanishing gradient problem. It uses gates (input, output, forget) to regulate information flow. A type of feedforward artificial neural network consisting of multiple layers of nodes in a directed graph, where each layer is fully connected to the next one. It\'s used for classification and regression tasks.
